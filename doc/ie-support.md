# IE Support

Official IEDriver resizes browser Window to capture full page images. This
behaviour does not work very well with fragment-wise visual regression
testing. We recommend you to use our [fork of Selenium
IEDriver](https://github.com/SevInf/IEDriver).

For IE8, using forked version is required.

Otherwise, instructions on running IEDriver are the same as for
[Selenium](http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/InternetExplorerDriver).
