## Gemini Commands

You need [Selenium-server](http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/) up and running if you want to run tests in real browsers.

Without Selenium Server only [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) browser can be used. In this case, run
PhantomJS in webdriver mode before executing **Gemini**:

```
phantomjs --webdriver=4444
```

### Gathering Reference Images

Once you have few suites written you need to capture reference images:

```
gemini gather [paths to suites]
```

If no paths are specified, each `.js` file from `gemini` directory will be processed.
By default, configuration will be loaded from `.gemini.yml` in the current directory.
To specify other config, use `--config` or `-c` option.

### Running Tests

To compare you reference screenshots with current state of blocks, use:

```
gemini test [paths to suites]
```

Paths and configuration are treated the same way as in `gather` command.

Each state with appearance different from reference image will be treated
as the failed test.

By default, only names of the states are listed in shell. To get more information
you can use HTML reporter:

`gemini test --reporter html [paths to suites]`

This will produce an HTML file in `gemini-report` directory. It will
display reference image, current image and differences between them,
for each state in each browser.

Available reporters are:

* `flat` (default console reporter)
* `html` for HTML report

You can also use multiple reporters at the same time using multiple `--reporter` options:

```
gemini test --reporter flat --reporter html
```

#### CSS Code Coverage (experimental)

Path `--coverage` (or set `coverage` option in config file) to enable code coverage reporter.
**Gemini** will examine your CSS files and report CSS rules that had been captured by at least
one test completely (green color in report), partially (yellow) or was not captured at all
(red).

### Common CLI Options

* `--config`, `-c` - specify config file to use.
* `--root-url`, `-r` - use specified URL instead of `rootUrl` setting from config file.
* `--grid-url`, `-g` - use specified URL instead of `gridUrl` setting from config file.
* `--grep PATTERN` â€“ execute only suites with names that match the regular expression pattern.
* `--help` - display help message.
* `--version` - display version.

### Shell Completion

To enable Tab-completion of the shell commands add `. <(gemini completion)` to your shell rc-file (
for example `~/.bashrc` for `bash` or `~/.zshrc` for `zsh`).
